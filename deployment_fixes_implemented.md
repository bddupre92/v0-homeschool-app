# Homeschool App Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

After analyzing the Vercel deployment logs and implementing fixes, I've addressed the following issues that were preventing successful deployment:

### 1. Recursive Reference in .env File

**Issue**: The error "Maximum call stack size exceeded" was occurring during environment variable loading.

**Fix**: 
- Removed quotation marks from environment variable values in the .env file
- Created a clean .env.production template for Vercel deployment

### 2. Module Resolution with Path Aliases

**Issue**: The build was failing with "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/data-context'" and similar errors.

**Fix**:
- Created a new next.config.js file with explicit webpack configuration for path aliases:
```javascript
webpack: (config) => {
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    '@': '.'
  };
  return config;
}
```
- Removed the invalid 'appDir' experimental option that was causing warnings

### 3. Tailwind CSS Installation Issues

**Issue**: The build was failing with "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" despite it being in package.json.

**Fix**:
- Reinstalled Tailwind CSS and its dependencies with specific versions
- Moved Tailwind CSS from devDependencies to dependencies in package.json
- Installed missing tailwindcss-animate package that was required by the application

### 4. Vercel Configuration

**Issue**: The deployment was using --legacy-peer-deps which might have been causing issues.

**Fix**:
- Updated vercel.json to use standard npm install commands without the --legacy-peer-deps flag

## Files Modified

1. **/.env**: Removed quotation marks from values to prevent recursive reference issues
2. **/next.config.js**: Created new configuration with proper webpack alias setup
3. **/package.json**: Updated dependencies and moved Tailwind CSS to dependencies section
4. **/vercel.json**: Updated build and install commands
5. **/.env.production**: Created template for production environment variables

## Testing

The application has been tested locally and runs successfully with all the implemented fixes. The development server starts without errors and the application loads correctly.

## Next Steps

These fixes should resolve the deployment issues on Vercel. The next step is to deploy the application with these changes and configure the atozfamily.org domain.
