# Authentication System Requirements for Homeschool App

After analyzing the homeschool app repository and its requirements, I've identified the following authentication system needs to secure the application and provide personalized user experiences.

## Authentication Requirements

### User Authentication Methods

1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - Secure password storage with proper hashing (bcrypt/Argon2)
   - Email verification process
   - Password reset functionality
   - Password strength requirements
   - Account recovery options

2. **Social Authentication**
   - Google authentication (popular with educators)
   - Apple authentication (required for iOS app)
   - Facebook authentication (optional)
   - Microsoft authentication (useful for schools using Microsoft services)

3. **Magic Link Authentication**
   - Passwordless email link authentication
   - Secure token generation and validation
   - Expiration and single-use mechanisms

### Session Management

1. **Session Handling**
   - Secure session tokens
   - Configurable session duration
   - Session renewal mechanisms
   - Multiple device sessions
   - Session revocation capabilities

2. **Remember Me Functionality**
   - Long-lived sessions with secure refresh tokens
   - Device fingerprinting for additional security
   - Easy session termination

### User Management

1. **User Registration**
   - Self-service registration
   - Admin-created accounts
   - Family/group account creation
   - Profile completion workflows

2. **User Profiles**
   - Basic profile information
   - Educational preferences
   - Privacy settings
   - Profile picture and customization

3. **Account Management**
   - Email change with verification
   - Password change
   - Account deletion/deactivation
   - Data export (for compliance)

### Authorization

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Admin role (full system access)
   - Parent role (manage family accounts, content creation)
   - Student role (limited access based on age/grade)
   - Teacher role (content creation, limited admin functions)
   - Guest role (public content only)

2. **Permission System**
   - Granular permissions for different features
   - Content-level permissions (view, edit, delete)
   - Sharing permissions
   - Permission inheritance for group structures

3. **Multi-tenancy**
   - Family account grouping
   - Classroom/group isolation
   - Content sharing between tenants

### Security Features

1. **Account Protection**
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Account lockout mechanisms
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA)

2. **Compliance**
   - COPPA compliance for children under 13
   - GDPR/CCPA data privacy compliance
   - Educational data protection (FERPA if applicable)
   - Audit logging for security events

## Recommended Authentication Solutions

**Implementation Requirements:**
- NextAuth.js configuration
- Database adapter for session storage
- Custom pages for authentication flows
- Role and permission implementation
- Integration with user database model

### 2. Supabase Auth

**Advantages:**
- Built-in authentication with PostgreSQL database
- Row-level security for data protection
- Multiple authentication providers
- User management dashboard
- Email templates and customization

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Supabase project setup
- Client-side integration
- Custom UI components
- Role management implementation
- Security policy configuration

### 3. Firebase Authentication

**Advantages:**
- Comprehensive authentication service
- Multiple authentication providers
- Phone authentication
- User management dashboard
- Seamless integration with Firebase ecosystem

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Firebase project setup
- Client-side SDK integration
- Custom UI components
- Security rules configuration
- Role management implementation

### 4. Custom Authentication Solution

**Advantages:**
- Complete control over authentication flow
- Tailored to specific application needs
- No external dependencies
- Custom security features

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Secure password hashing
- Token generation and validation
- Session management
- Email service integration
- Significant development effort

## Recommendation

Based on the requirements of the homeschool app and the existing Next.js architecture, I recommend implementing **NextAuth.js (Auth.js)** for the following reasons:

1. **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with Next.js and the existing project structure.

2. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple authentication providers, allowing users to choose their preferred login method.

3. **Simplicity**: Reduces development time with pre-built components and flows.

4. **Security**: Implements security best practices out of the box.

5. **Scalability**: Can grow with the application's needs and user base.

6. **Vercel Compatibility**: Works well with Vercel deployment, which is the recommended hosting platform.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Install NextAuth.js
   - Configure basic providers (email/password, Google)
   - Set up database adapter for PostgreSQL

2. **User Interface**
   - Create sign-in/sign-up pages
   - Implement password reset flow
   - Design profile management screens

3. **Authorization System**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create permission system
   - Add middleware for protected routes

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement 2FA (optional)
   - Set up security monitoring

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Security testing
   - User flow testing
   - Performance testing

By implementing this authentication system, the homeschool app will have a secure, user-friendly authentication experience that supports the various user roles and access requirements of an educational platform.
