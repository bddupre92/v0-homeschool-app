## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Database Migration Issues**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption during schema changes
   - Mitigation: Create comprehensive backup strategy, use Prisma migrations, test thoroughly

2. **Authentication Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Security breaches or unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Follow security best practices, conduct security audits, use established libraries

3. **Mobile Compatibility Issues**
   - Risk: Poor performance or functionality on mobile devices
   - Mitigation: Test early and often on various devices, implement responsive design from the start

4. **Domain Configuration Delays**
   - Risk: DNS propagation delays or configuration issues
   - Mitigation: Start domain configuration early, have fallback domains ready

5. **API Integration Limitations**
   - Risk: API rate limits or functionality changes
   - Mitigation: Implement proper error handling, caching, and fallback mechanisms

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to transforming the homeschool app into a fully functional, production-ready application with iOS compatibility. By following this timeline and addressing the outlined tasks, the application can be successfully deployed with the atozfamily.org domain and prepared for an iOS app version.

The roadmap is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on changing requirements or unforeseen challenges. Regular progress reviews and milestone validations will ensure the project stays on track and meets all requirements.
