- [ ] Environment-specific configurations are managed
- [ ] Database migrations are automated
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented and tested
- [ ] Load balancing is configured if needed
- [ ] SSL certificates are properly configured
- [ ] Domain and DNS are properly set up

## üîß Common Production Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Check Firebase configuration
node -e "console.log(require('./lib/firebase.ts'))"

# Verify environment variables
grep -E "FIREBASE|AUTH" .env.local
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npx @next/bundle-analyzer

# Check for unused dependencies
npx depcheck
```

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

### Bundle Size Targets
- **First Load JS**: < 130kb
- **Total Bundle Size**: < 500kb

## üö® Pre-Deployment Final Check

Before deploying to production, run these final checks:

```bash
# 1. Run all tests
npm run test

# 2. Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Run production checker
node scripts/production-check.js

# 5. Security audit
npm audit --audit-level=high

# 6. Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## üìû Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Process
1. Identify the last known good deployment
2. Revert to previous version via hosting platform
3. Verify functionality with smoke tests
4. Communicate status to stakeholders

### Incident Response
1. **Detect**: Monitor alerts and user reports
2. **Assess**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Respond**: Implement immediate fixes or rollback
4. **Communicate**: Update stakeholders and users
5. **Learn**: Conduct post-incident review
