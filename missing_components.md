# Missing Components for Homeschool App Deployment

After reviewing the GitHub repository at https://github.com/bddupre92/v0-homeschool-app, I've identified several missing components that need to be addressed before the application can be fully deployed as a live, functioning webpage ready for an iOS app.

## Authentication System
- No user authentication mechanism is implemented
- Missing login/signup functionality
- No session management or user state persistence
- No role-based access control for different user types (parents, students, etc.)

## Database Integration
- The application uses hardcoded sample data throughout
- No database connection configuration
- Missing API routes for data persistence
- No data models or schemas defined
- No CRUD operations implemented for real data

## Backend API
- No backend API implementation for data operations
- Missing server-side validation
- No API endpoints for the various features (boards, planner, resources, etc.)
- Missing integration with external services

## Domain Configuration
- No custom domain configuration for atozfamily.org
- Missing DNS settings and verification for Vercel deployment

## Data Persistence
- No state management solution for client-side data
- Missing data synchronization between devices
- No offline capabilities

## Security Features
- Missing HTTPS configuration
- No data encryption for sensitive information
- Missing input validation and sanitization
- No protection against common web vulnerabilities

## iOS App Preparation
- No React Native or other mobile framework integration
- Missing responsive design optimizations for mobile
- No app manifest or configuration for iOS
- Missing native app wrappers or build configurations

## Deployment Configuration
- Incomplete Vercel deployment configuration
- Missing environment variables setup
- No CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Testing
- No unit tests or integration tests
- Missing end-to-end testing
- No performance testing

These missing components need to be implemented to transform the current frontend-only prototype into a fully functional, production-ready application that can be deployed with the atozfamily.org domain and prepared for an iOS app version.
