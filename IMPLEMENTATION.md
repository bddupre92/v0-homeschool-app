# A to Z Family Homeschool App - Implementation Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the homeschool application implementation, including architecture, features, and technical details.

## Architecture Overview

The A to Z Family Homeschool App is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Core Features

### Authentication System
- Secure user registration and login
- Session management with NextAuth.js
- Protected routes with AuthGuard component

### Boards
- Create, view, edit, and delete boards
- Add, update, and delete board items
- Organize items by status (todo, in-progress, completed)
- Drag-and-drop functionality for item management

### Resources
- Create, view, edit, and delete educational resources
- Categorize resources by type
- Add external links to resources
- Search and filter functionality

### Planner
- Weekly and monthly planning views
- Add, edit, and delete planner items
- Schedule recurring events
- Calendar integration

### Dashboard
- Overview of recent boards and resources
- Quick access to frequently used items
- Activity summary

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The application uses Prisma with PostgreSQL and includes the following models:
- User
- Board
- BoardItem
- Resource
- PlannerItem
- Account (for NextAuth.js)
- Session (for NextAuth.js)

### API Routes
The backend is implemented using Next.js API routes:
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- `/api/boards` - Board management
- `/api/boards/[id]` - Individual board operations
- `/api/boards/[id]/items` - Board items management
- `/api/resources` - Resource management
- `/api/planners` - Planner management

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers or logs in
2. NextAuth.js creates and manages sessions
3. Protected routes check session status
4. API routes verify authentication before processing requests

### Data Context
A React context provider (`DataContext`) manages:
- Data fetching and caching
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Loading and error states
- Real-time updates

### UI Components
The application uses a combination of:
- Custom UI components with the original V0 aesthetic
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Animations and transitions for a polished user experience
- Dark mode support

## Mobile Optimization

The application is fully optimized for mobile devices:
- Responsive layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly UI elements
- Mobile-specific navigation
- Performance optimizations for slower connections

## Deployment Configuration

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:
- `vercel.json` with build and environment settings
- Environment variables for authentication and database connection
- Domain configuration for atozfamily.org
- Automatic SSL/TLS certificate provisioning

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Native mobile app using React Native
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with third-party educational platforms
- Collaborative features for multiple users
- Offline support with service workers

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the application:
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor database performance
- Back up data regularly
- Test thoroughly before deploying updates

## Support and Resources
