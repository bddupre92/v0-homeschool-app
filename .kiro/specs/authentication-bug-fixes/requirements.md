# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication and navigation issues in the homeschool application. Users are currently experiencing errors when attempting to sign up, sign in, or use Google authentication. The application needs comprehensive testing and bug fixes to ensure all authentication flows work correctly and all pages are functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Authentication Context Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up with email and password so that I can create an account and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the sign-up form with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new user account successfully
2. WHEN a user submits the sign-up form with invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN a user successfully signs up THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the email verification page
4. WHEN the authentication context is missing required methods THEN the system SHALL implement signUp, signIn, and signInWithGoogle methods

### Requirement 2: Fix Google Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I can quickly access the application without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL open the Google authentication popup
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL create or sign in the user account
3. WHEN a user cancels the Google authentication THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages

### Requirement 3: Fix Firebase Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Firebase configuration to be properly set up so that authentication services work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required Firebase environment variables
2. WHEN Firebase environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN Firebase is properly configured THEN the system SHALL initialize all Firebase services correctly
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options for testing

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Page Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages and navigation to work correctly so that I can access all features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the system SHALL load the page without errors
2. WHEN a user clicks navigation links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct pages
3. WHEN a user accesses protected pages without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to sign-in
4. WHEN a user accesses protected pages with authentication THEN the system SHALL display the page content

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages based on the failure type
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate retry options
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic fields with clear messages
4. WHEN the system is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators to inform the user

### Requirement 6: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in with "remember me" checked THEN the system SHALL persist the authentication state
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain the authentication state if previously remembered
3. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication state
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly

### Requirement 7: Protected Route Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically redirected to appropriate pages based on my authentication status so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page THEN the system SHALL redirect to the sign-in page
2. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to their intended destination or dashboard
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses sign-in or sign-up pages THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard
4. WHEN authentication is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading state instead of redirecting
