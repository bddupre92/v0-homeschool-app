# Domain Requirements for atozfamily.org

Based on the user's requirement to deploy the homeschool app with the domain atozfamily.org on Vercel, I've identified the following domain configuration requirements and steps.

## Domain Registration Status

The user mentioned they already own the domain atozfamily.org but are "struggling to get it integrated on Vercel when deploying." This indicates the domain is already registered but needs proper configuration for use with Vercel.

## Domain Configuration Requirements for Vercel

### DNS Configuration Options

There are two main methods to configure the domain with Vercel:

#### 1. Using DNS Records (Recommended for most cases)
- **For apex domain (atozfamily.org)**:
  - Add an A record pointing to Vercel's load balancer IP: `76.76.21.21`
  - Add an AAAA record pointing to Vercel's IPv6 address: `2606:4700:20::681a:be5`
  
- **For www subdomain (www.atozfamily.org)**:
  - Add a CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

#### 2. Using Vercel as Nameservers
- Change the nameservers at your domain registrar to Vercel's nameservers:
  - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
  - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
  
This option gives Vercel full control over DNS management and is recommended for domains that will be exclusively used with Vercel.

### Domain Verification

- Vercel will need to verify domain ownership
- This is typically done automatically when DNS records are properly configured
- For domains already in use elsewhere, a TXT record may be required for verification

### SSL Certificate

- Vercel automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates
- No manual configuration is required for HTTPS
- Certificates are issued through Let's Encrypt

## Steps to Configure atozfamily.org with Vercel

1. **Add Domain in Vercel Dashboard**
   - Log in to Vercel dashboard
   - Select the homeschool app project
   - Go to Settings > Domains
   - Enter "atozfamily.org" in the domain field
   - Vercel will prompt to add both apex domain and www subdomain

2. **Choose Redirect Option**
   - Redirect www to apex (atozfamily.org)
   - Redirect apex to www (www.atozfamily.org)
   - No redirect (both work independently)

3. **Configure DNS at Domain Registrar**
   - Log in to the domain registrar where atozfamily.org is registered
   - Navigate to DNS management
   - Add the required A, AAAA, or CNAME records as instructed by Vercel
   - Alternatively, change nameservers to Vercel's nameservers

4. **Verify Domain Configuration**
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, but often much faster)
   - Vercel will automatically verify the domain once DNS is properly configured
   - Check the Domains section in Vercel dashboard for verification status

5. **Test Domain**
   - Once verified, test accessing the application via the custom domain
   - Verify HTTPS is working correctly
   - Test both apex domain and www subdomain

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **DNS Propagation Delays**
   - DNS changes can take time to propagate globally
   - Use tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check propagation status

2. **Incorrect DNS Records**
   - Double-check record types (A, AAAA, CNAME)
   - Verify IP addresses and values are correct
   - Ensure no conflicting records exist

3. **Domain Verification Issues**
   - If domain verification fails, check for TXT record requirements
   - Ensure domain ownership is properly established

4. **SSL Certificate Problems**
   - If SSL doesn't provision automatically, check DNS configuration
   - Ensure no CAA records are blocking Let's Encrypt

5. **Domain in Use by Another Vercel Account**
   - If the domain was previously used with another Vercel account, additional verification steps may be required

## Additional Considerations

1. **Domain Privacy**
   - Ensure WHOIS privacy protection is enabled at the registrar level if desired

2. **Domain Renewal**
   - Keep domain registration current to avoid service interruption
   - Consider auto-renewal options

3. **Subdomain Configuration**
   - Additional subdomains can be added later for specific features
   - Each subdomain would need its own DNS configuration

4. **Email Configuration**
   - If email services are needed for the domain, additional MX records will be required
   - These can coexist with the Vercel configuration

By following these steps and requirements, the homeschool app should be successfully deployed and accessible via the atozfamily.org domain on Vercel.
