   - Referential integrity

4. **Data Validation**
   - Schema validation
   - Type checking
   - Required fields enforcement
   - Custom validation rules

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Low latency for read operations
   - Efficient write operations
   - Indexing for common queries
   - Caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Handling increasing data volume
   - Connection pooling
   - Efficient resource utilization

3. **Security**
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Secure connections
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

4. **Reliability**
   - Data backup and recovery
   - High availability
   - Fault tolerance
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Database Options

### 1. PostgreSQL (Recommended)
- **Advantages**

  - Good integration with Prisma ORM
  - Available as managed service on many platforms

- **Deployment Options**
  - Vercel Postgres
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL with additional features)
  - Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)
  - AWS RDS
  - Digital Ocean Managed Database

### 2. MongoDB

  - Firebase (Google Cloud)

## Recommendation

Based on the requirements of the homeschool app, I recommend using **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM** for the following reasons:

1. **Structured Data**: The app has well-defined relationships between entities that benefit from a relational database.

2. **Complex Queries**: Features like searching resources, filtering planner items, and community interactions require robust query capabilities.

3. **Data Integrity**: Educational content and user data benefit from ACID compliance and strong consistency.

4. **Flexibility**: PostgreSQL's JSON support provides flexibility when needed without sacrificing structure.

5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Excellent integration with Next.js and Vercel through Prisma ORM.

6. **Deployment Options**: Multiple hosting options including Vercel's native PostgreSQL offering for seamless integration.

For implementation, I recommend:
- Using Prisma for database schema definition and migrations
- Implementing a repository pattern for data access
- Adding a caching layer (like Redis or Vercel KV) for frequently accessed data
- Setting up proper indexing for common query patterns
- Implementing data validation at both ORM and API levels
