# Backend Requirements for Homeschool App

After analyzing the current state of the homeschool app repository, I've identified the following backend requirements needed to transform it from a frontend-only application to a fully functional web application.

## API Routes and Server Components

### Current Status
- The repository contains only client-side components with mock data
- No API routes are implemented
- No server-side data fetching or processing

### Requirements
1. **Next.js API Routes**
   - Implement `/api` routes for all data operations
   - Create RESTful endpoints for each resource (users, boards, lessons, etc.)
   - Add middleware for request validation and authentication
   - Implement error handling and response formatting

2. **Server Components**
   - Convert appropriate components to React Server Components
   - Implement server-side data fetching
   - Add server-side rendering for SEO and performance

## Serverless Functions

### Requirements
1. **Vercel Serverless Functions**
   - Implement backend logic in serverless functions
   - Create utility functions for common operations
   - Set up environment variables for configuration
   - Add proper error handling and logging

2. **Edge Functions (Optional)**
   - Implement performance-critical operations at the edge
   - Create edge middleware for authentication and caching
   - Optimize for global performance

## Backend Services

### Requirements
1. **Authentication Service**
   - User registration and login
   - Session management
   - Password reset functionality
   - Social login integration
   - Role-based access control

2. **Data Processing Service**
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Business logic implementation
   - Data transformation and formatting
   - Scheduled tasks and background processing

3. **File Storage Service**
   - Upload and download functionality
   - File type validation
   - Secure access control
   - Image optimization and processing

4. **Notification Service**
   - Email notifications
   - In-app notifications
   - Push notifications for mobile
   - Notification preferences management

## Security Requirements

1. **API Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - CORS configuration
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

2. **Data Security**
   - Encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure data transmission (HTTPS)
   - Data access controls
   - Compliance with privacy regulations

## Integration Requirements

1. **Third-Party Services**
   - Payment processing (if needed)
   - Email service integration
   - Analytics integration
   - External API integrations

2. **Webhooks**
   - Implement webhook endpoints for external services
   - Create webhook handlers for event processing
   - Add webhook security and validation

## Development and Deployment

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local backend development setup
   - Testing tools and frameworks
   - Documentation for API endpoints
   - Environment configuration

2. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Environment variables for Vercel
   - Deployment scripts and workflows
   - Monitoring and logging setup
   - Backup and recovery procedures

## Recommended Backend Stack

Based on the current Next.js frontend and planned Vercel deployment, I recommend the following backend stack:

1. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (Auth.js)
   - Seamless integration with Next.js
   - Support for multiple authentication providers
   - Session management built-in
   - Easy to implement role-based access control

2. **Database Access**: Prisma ORM
   - Type-safe database client
   - Schema management and migrations
   - Support for multiple databases
   - Easy to use with TypeScript

3. **API Development**: tRPC or Next.js API Routes
   - Type-safe API development
   - Seamless integration with React Query
   - Automatic documentation
   - Easy to implement validation

4. **File Storage**: Vercel Blob or AWS S3
   - Scalable file storage
   - Easy integration with Next.js
   - Good performance and reliability
   - Cost-effective for various file sizes

5. **Serverless Functions**: Vercel Functions
   - Native support in Vercel deployment
   - Automatic scaling
   - Low operational overhead
   - Good performance characteristics

This backend stack provides a modern, scalable solution that integrates well with the existing Next.js frontend and can be deployed easily on Vercel.
